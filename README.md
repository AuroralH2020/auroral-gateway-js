# AURORAL NODE Gateway JS #

This README documents the agent component of the AURORAL node, which is funded by European Unionâ€™s Horizon 2020 Framework Programme for Research and Innovation under grant agreement no 101016854 AURORAL.

## Pre-requisites ##

Recommended software and skills:

- GIT
- Docker
- Docker compose 

## Dependencies ##

AURORAL Node Gateway is a part of the AURORAL Node, which is a client to connect IoT infrastructures with AURORAL.

For minimal functionality, the AURORAL Gateway needs an instance of the AURORAL Agent and an instance of REDIS db.

In order to access an IoT infrastructure or platform, it is necessary to run an AURORAL Adapter.

Examples and more information about how to run the AURORAL Node Agent is available in the [AURORAL Node repository](https://github.com/AuroralH2020/auroral-node/wiki).

## Deployment ##

It is possible to run the AURORAL Node Gateway as a docker image.

Refer to [AURORAL Node repository](https://github.com/AuroralH2020/auroral-node/wiki) for more information about deployment.

## Images ##

Available DOCKER images for AMD64, ARM64 and ARM7 architectures.
